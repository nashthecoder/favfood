# Easy Grilled Chicken Sandwiches

This recipe comes to us from FDP team member Bri DeRosa and her blog Red Round or Green.
These sandwiches are a knock-off of a simple sandwich that I ate at restaurants as a kid.  You can add mayo or mustard or whatever you like on your chicken sandwiches; for me, it’s the plain-Jane version with just some good lettuce and tomato that does the trick. The marinade is also a fabulous salad dressing, so you can make extras and store in a mason jar in the refrigerator — it will last for weeks that way.  

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into roughly 4-oz portions (you want the chicken to fit the buns, essentially)

### Marinade:
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper
* 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 2 tsp. honey
* 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 6 tablespoons olive oil

Sandwich buns of your choice, preferably lightly toasted or grilled
* Lettuce leaves
* Sliced tomatoes
* Instructions

1. Whisk the ingredients for the marinade in a medium bowl until thoroughly combined.
2. Pour over the chicken and toss to coat.
3. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, and up to 8 hours.
4. Grill the chicken breasts over medium heat for 12-14 minutes, just until cooked through.
5. Allow the chicken to rest for 5-10 minutes before making the sandwiches.
6. Pile a few lettuce leaves, several slices of tomato, and a piece of chicken onto a lightly toasted bun. Add condiments if you wish.

>These sandwiches taste best when you eat them in your backyard with a cold drink and good friends.
